\section{Introduction}
The 24x7 Event and Group catalog is the performance counter consumer's
translator from ``Event Name'' to ``Counter Data'' through the PowerVM
H\_Get24x7Data hcall. Data available in the event entry or group entry in the
catalog is passed through the hcall so that the PowerVM can return the correct
data from the 24x7 ``In Memory Accumulators''.

Clients looking for a specific counter's data, search the events array for a
matching event name. When found, the event entry will contain an IMA Group
Record Offset and an IMA Group Record Length. These two values, along with some
configuration specifics are passed to the PowerVM through the H\_Get24x7Data
hcall to retrieve the Event Group Record. The event entry also contains an
offset into the Event Group Record where the desired counter can be found.

Often clients want a group of event counters so that together more complex
metrics can be computed. Clients will search the groups array for a matching
group name. When found the group entry will, like the event entry, contain an
IMA Group Record Offset and an IBM Group Record Length. These two values, along
with some configuration specifics are passed to the PowerVM through the
H\_Get24x7Data hcall to retrieve the Event Group Record. The group entry also
contains a list of event entry indexes so that the offsets (found through the
event entry) can be use to retrieve desired counters from the Event Group
Record.

The figure below illustrates these relationships.

\textit{Design Note:} The ``Length'' field and ``Version Number'' size and offset is fixed
since the hypervisor will fill in the Length when the catalog is read from the
fsp flash lid table and will compare the Version Number for consistency on each
hypervisor call. The offset to the events and groups are relative to the main
event group page and the group data page. In cases where there are no group for
particular sub-group (like thread or chip), the offset at such field will be
filled with '0xffffffff' to mark it as invalid.

\subsection{Event Data Entry Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``Event Name Field Length'', ``Event Description Field Length'' and ``Event
  Detailed Description Field Length'' fields INCLUDE the length of the length
  field. To point to the start of the next field's length add the current
  field's length. Thus a field length value of 2 indicates the text string is
  empty.
\item For events that are being accumulated in chip groups, each event will have
  an accumulated counter value and a ``Last Sample Increment'' value. The short
  name for the event which returns the ``Last Sample Increment'' will merely be
  the accumulated counter's Event Name with the ``\_SAMPLE'' suffix added. The
  ``Last Sample Increment'' event data will not have an event description or a
  detailed event description.
\item There are two, special core level events: HPM\_NON\_IDLE\_INST and
  HPMC\_NON\_IDLE\_PCYC which are available in all core groups in the
  GRS\_COUNTER\_3 and GRS\_COUNTER\_4 schema ENUM positions.
\item For some events that are being accumulated in core groups, those events
  will have counter versions available which are filtered by ``context
  state''. For those events with a ``filtered by user'' state counter available,
  the event name will have the suffix \_USER appended. For those events with a
  ``filtered by kernel'' state counter available, the event name will have the
  suffix \_KERNEL appended. The ``filtered'' event data will not have an event
  description or a detailed event description.

\section{Schema Data}
These schemas are the same ones proposed in the 24x7 Requirements Document.

\subsection{Core and Chip Event Counter Group Record}
The Event Counter Group Record is a structure in memory containing the event
counters and administrative data accumulated by the hardware. The layout of this
structure is fixed in hardware, but is not guaranteed to be common across all
hardware processor versions or families.

Refer to the PORE/SLW workbook for the exact definition of this structure, but
examples of these structures can be found below.

\end{table}

The layout of an event counter group record is communicated dynamically through
a structure returned in the Get Event Counter Group Schema interface called the
Event Counter Group Schema. The structure used to accumulate counters in core
event group records differs from the structure used to accumulate counters in
chip event group records. Among the chip event group records, structure sizes
may differ. The Group Schema Index in the catalog group data entry indicates
which schema to use.

\subsection{Core and Chip Event Counter Group Record Schema
(GRS)}
The Event Counter Group Record Schema is a structure returned by the Get Event
Counter Group Record Schema hypervisor interface. This structure indirectly
defines the Event Counter Group Record using architected ENUMs, offsets and
lengths.

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

The ``Field Enum'' values will be consistent as the hardware design changes. If
any part of the structure changes, the Schema Version Id will change.

OS implementations are free to define fixed structures that will only apply to
known schema versions.

\subsection{Formula Entry Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``Formula Name Field Length'', ``Formula Description Field Length'' and
  ``Formula Field Length'' fields INCLUDE the length of the length field. To point
  to the start of the next field's length add the current field's length. Thus a
  field length value of 2 indicates the text string is empty.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formula Syntax}
The Formula Field of a Formula Data Record will contain text that complies with
a simple syntax that should make parsing and interpretation easier.

The text will follow a general ``stack-based'', ``Reverse Polish Notation'' (or
``Post-fix Notation'' evaluation model generalized this way:

\begin{center}
  \texttt{
    operand [ operand | operator [ operand | operator ] [ \dots ] ]
  }
\end{center}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Operand is either a text Event Name which can be found among the Event
  Data records, another Formula Name, a constant in standard floating point
  representation or a symbolic constant familiar to performance analysts such as
  `delta-timebase', `delta-cycles', `delta-instructions', and `delta-seconds'.
\item Operator is any of the standard mathematical text characters: `+', `-',
  `*', or `/', or these lowercase, three-character mathematical abbreviations:
  `mod', `rem', `sqr', or `x\^{}y', or these three-character stack manipulators:
  `swp', `rot', and `dup'.

\end{itemize}
Note that most operators require two operands, but some only require one.

Also be aware that most formulas can be extended to aggregate chips or cores if
the operands are first properly summed across all the domain resources of
interest.

To evaluate a formula, the interpreter implements a push-up operand stack where
new operands are added to the bottom of the stack (the x register) and operators
consume or manipulate the bottom-most operand and potentially (in the case of
two-operand operators) the operand immediately above the bottom (the y
register), placing the result back on the bottom of the stack. When the formula
interpretation is complete, the final result will be left at the bottom of the
stack.

\textit{Note:} Existing pmlist data represents formulas using standard ``infix''
notation. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
# pmlist -DPMD_CPU_UTIL
Derived Metric: PMD_CPU_UTIL (unit:%) (CPU Utilization)
Formula : PM_RUN_CYC / PM_CYC * 100
Description :
Metric Groups : General
Groups : 0
\end{verbatim}

                       \parbox[t]{7cm} {
                       Corrections from John Attinella \\
  Addition of several flags similar to those used in PMC Event filtering \\
  Addition of the Group Index and Group Count fields to the Eventdata catalog
  record \\
  } \\ \hline
  v012 & 2013-03-28 & Added the concept of ``derived metrics'' through ``named
                      formulas'' using an additional ``Formula Data'' table. \\ \hline
  v0.13 & 2013-04-22 & Added build date-stamp to catalog. Clarified that there
                       may be several schemas to describe the various chip event
                       group records. Added a group record length to the event
                       data to save having to look up the length. \\ \hline
  v0.14 & 2013-04-24 & Added the same domain, group offset and length data
                       necessary to locate individual events to the group table
                       entry. Moved entry counts to Page 0 \\ \hline
  v0.15 & 2013-05-21 & Ooops! Mike Vance corrected me on the catalog version length.
                       Removed Questions section and marked as approved by common
                       consent. Typos. \\ \hline
